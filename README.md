# CurrencyConverter
CurrencyConverter is yet another sample Android Project which utilize recent Android Development Tech Stack from my developer point of view.

The goal of the project is to practise Kotlin Flow and show the 1 second interval updated currency list in RecyclerView.
The software components in the project are testable and developed by using SOLID principles.
